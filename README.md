## ðŸ“‹ Project Description
My final project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I showcase the skills and tools I have acquired, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

The project focuses on analyzing restaurant locations in Berlin to identify key patterns and actionable insights for selecting the optimal location for a new restaurant. This real-world scenario not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also applies data-driven methods to a practical business challenge.

## ðŸŽ¯ Analysis Goals
The primary goals of this analysis are:

- Demographic Insights: Understanding how population and diversity influence restaurant distribution.
- Restaurant Density Analysis: Identifying areas with high restaurant density and hotspots for new ventures.
- Culinary Preferences: Analyzing the popularity of different cuisines and their correlation with demographics.


## Objective
The objective of this project is to apply data analytics and geospatial analysis to support location-based business decisions, specifically for the restaurant industry in Berlin. Hopefully I will demonstrate how data-driven approaches can optimize decision-making processes in urban environments.


## Overview of the Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Downloading demographic and geospatial data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
3. **Analysis:** Exploring insights and visualizations to answer the key questions.
4. **Conclusion:** Summarizing findings and providing actionable recommendations.



## Step 1: Data Collection
To ensure a reliable analysis, we sourced data from:
- **Demographic data:** [Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg](https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/)  
  - Includes population distribution, density, and other metrics by district.
- **Geospatial data:** [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)  
  - The data includes `.shp` files for:
     - District boundaries.
     - Restaurant locations.
     - Transport hubs.
     - Residential areas.


Below are the steps for downloading and importing this data into our analysis environment.


## Step 2: Data Wrangling

To ensure accuracy and usability, the raw data was cleaned and prepared using multiple tools and techniques:

### Geospatial Data
1. **Opening and Visualizing in QGIS:**  
   The `.shp` files were loaded into **QGIS** for visualization and initial inspection. This allowed me to:
   - Verify the structure of the geospatial data.
   - Explore attribute tables for missing or inconsistent values.
   - Devide points of interest by neighbourhood.
   - Calculating areas and densities for polygons.

2. **Database Integration with PostgreSQL:**  
   Using QGIS, I connected to a **PostgreSQL** database and imported the cleaned `.shp` files into a spatial database.  
   - **Why PostgreSQL?**  
     PostgreSQL, with its PostGIS extension, is ideal for handling and analyzing geospatial data.

3. **Preparation in DBeaver:**  
   I used **DBeaver**, a database management tool, to write SQL scripts for cleaning and organizing the imported geospatial data.  
   - Example SQL tasks included:
     - Removing duplicate or irrelevant rows.
     - Standardizing attribute names.
   

### Demographic Data
1. **Excel for Initial Cleaning:**  
   The demographic data was processed in Excel to:
   - Combine all the Data into manageable parts.



## Data Wrangling: Cleaning Cuisine Types

One of the most time-consuming tasks in this project was cleaning and standardizing the "cuisine" column in the dataset. The raw data contained inconsistent and overlapping entries for restaurant types, which required careful processing to ensure accuracy and consistency.

For example some entries included multiple cuisines in a single row, separated by semicolons (e.g., `italian;ice_cream`).

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **Duplicates and Variations:** Many cuisines were represented in different formats or combined with other cuisines.
2. **Ambiguous Entries:** Some entries were unclear or needed manual categorization.
3. **Ensuring Consistency:** Each cuisine needed to be mapped to a single, standardized category.

### Cleaning Process
Using SQL scripts in PostgreSQL I queried the distinct cuisine types to understand the variations and inconsistencies:
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT cuisine
   FROM restaurants_clean rc 
   WHERE cuisine IS NOT NULL AND cuisine LIKE '%ital%';

   
UPDATE restaurants_clean 
SET cuisine = 'italian'
WHERE cuisine IN (
                              'italian;ice_cream'
                          ,'italian;international'
                 ,'international;regional;italian'
                                        ,'italian'
                            ,'italian;steak_house'
                              ,'italian;sardinian'
                              ,'ice_cream;italian'
                                  ,'italian;pasta'
                                   ,'italian;wine'
                 );
                
```

## Step 3: Transition to Tableau for Analysis

Once all the data was cleaned, standardized, and prepared in PostgreSQL, the final datasets were exported to **Tableau** for visualization and further analysis. 

## Berlin: A Growing and Diverse City
Berlin is a city on the rise, and this growth is fueled by people from around the world. Over the past decade, the percentage of non-German residents has grown from 16% to 25%. This demographic shift brings not only growth but also greater cultural diversity, which is reflected in the city's vibrant restaurant scene.

![Population of Berlin](./04_Reveal_js/assets/01A_Population%20of%20Berlin.jpg)

Here, we can see all 12 neighborhoods of Berlin along with their respective populations. To provide additional context, Iâ€™ve combined this data with the number of restaurants in each area, visually represented by pizza icons.

![Populationvs number of restaurants](./04_Reveal_js/assets/02B_Populationvs%20number%20of%20restaurants.jpg)

While some districts have large populations, the number of restaurants in these areas is not always proportional. This discrepancy raises questions about what truly drives the distribution of dining establishments across Berlin. To understand this better, we need to look at restaurant density, both in terms of population and area size.

When we combine population, restaurant density, and area size, some clear leaders emerge. Mitte, Charlottenburg, and Kreuzberg stand out as the top districts for dining. But interestingly, SchÃ¶neberg and Pankow also show strong potential, making them notable contenders in Berlinâ€™s restaurant scene.

### Exploring Culinary Preferences: The Top Cuisines in Berlin?
---
Now that weâ€™ve seen where restaurants thrive, letâ€™s dive deeper into what cuisines are driving this popularity.

![Tree map](./04_Reveal_js/assets/03A_Cuisines%20tree%20map.jpg)

Berlinâ€™s culinary landscape is as diverse as its population. Italian, Turkish, and Vietnamese cuisines dominate the top spots, reflecting the cityâ€™s cultural blend and evolving food trends. But the story doesnâ€™t stop thereâ€”letâ€™s explore how diverse these districts really are.

### Are Cuisines Where Migrants Are?
---
Do cuisines reflect the populations they represent? By comparing the locations of Turkish, Croatian, and French restaurants with the respective communities, we see mixed patterns. 
The upper row represents number of restaurants and lower row the population of certain migrant group. The darker the colour the bigger the number.

For example, Turkish restaurants align closely with Turkish communities in NeukÃ¶lln, but French restaurants are more concentrated in tourist-heavy areas like Mitte and Charlottenburg.

![Maps](./04_Reveal_js/assets/08_Maps.jpg)

When we look at these maps collectively, a striking pattern emerges: While these cuisines donâ€™t always perfectly overlap with the locations of their respective communities, they tend to cluster in similar geographic directions. For instance, Turkish cuisine dominates the southern districts, Croatian restaurants favor the southwestern areas, and French establishments stretch from the north through Charlottenburg and Mitte. 

This highlights that demographics are just one piece of the puzzle. Letâ€™s apply this to Annaâ€™s case and identify the best districts for a Greek restaurant.

Using everything weâ€™ve analyzed, we shortlist five districts: Mitte, Charlottenburg, Kreuzberg, SchÃ¶neberg, and Pankow. These districts represent areas where demand for dining might already be high or where opportunities for growth could still exist. By pinpointing districts that balance population, density, and accessibility, we can provide actionable insights for making informed business decisions.

However, by focusing on the Greek populationâ€™s distribution (south_central), 

![Anna2](./04_Reveal_js/assets/010_Anna_MAP_01.jpg)

And applying picked Neighbourhoods,

![Anna3](./04_Reveal_js/assets/010_Anna_MAP_02.jpg)

We can safely eliminate Pankow.

![Anna4](./04_Reveal_js/assets/010_Anna_MAP_03.jpg)

Even further if we remember the tree map. Building on the insights from the tree map, Greek restaurants account for approximately 3% of all restaurants across Berlin.

![Anna5](./04_Reveal_js/assets/010_Anna_Cuisines%20tree%20map.jpg)

 When we narrow our focus to the four neighborhoods identified earlier, it becomes clear that Charlottenburg and SchÃ¶neberg have a higher concentration of Greek restaurants, indicating greater competition in these areas. This insight provides valuable context for evaluating potential locations, balancing market demand with competitive presence.

| Neighbourhood | Greek Restaurants as % of the Total Number of Restaurants |
| :---: | :---: |
| Tempelhof-SchÃ¶neberg | 4.52% |
| Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf | 3.04% |
| Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg | 1.97% |
| Mitte | 0.94% |


## Step 4: Conclusion & Reflections

While there are certainly many more factors that influence business location decisionsâ€”such as market saturation, lease prices, seasonal trends, and local regulationsâ€”this project was designed to highlight the potential of geospatial data as a decision-support tool.

By combining simple, openly available datasets and visualizing them on a map, we begin to see how location-based patterns shape the urban business landscape. Even basic information about population distribution, public transport, and existing competition can provide valuable context when considering a new business venture.

Through this project, Iâ€™ve also experienced first-hand how much time and care go into working with real-world data. Data cleaning isnâ€™t just a technical stepâ€”itâ€™s the foundation for every insight that follows. Iâ€™ve learned that telling a clear story from messy data requires structure, patience, and knowing when less is more.

Most importantly, this work reminded me that data isnâ€™t about numbers alone. Itâ€™s about connecting information in a way that helps people make better decisionsâ€”with more clarity, more confidence, and a better understanding of the world around them.
