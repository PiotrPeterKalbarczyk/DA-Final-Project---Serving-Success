### DA-Final-Project---Serving-Success

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description
My final project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I showcase the skills and tools I have acquired, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

The project focuses on analyzing restaurant locations in Berlin to identify key patterns and actionable insights for selecting the optimal location for a new restaurant. This real-world scenario not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also applies data-driven methods to a practical business challenge.

The primary goals of this analysis are:

- Demographic Insights: Understanding how population and diversity influence restaurant distribution.
- Restaurant Density Analysis: Identifying areas with high restaurant density and hotspots for new ventures.
- Culinary Preferences: Analyzing the popularity of different cuisines and their correlation with demographics.
